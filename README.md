The aim of this project is to create an inventory system.
We have 4 tables namely: products, purchases, suppliers and orders

In this SQL Project I have used various functionalities such as:
  joins
  inbuilt functions
  aggregate functions
  case statement
  group by
  filtering using where and having
  limit
  constraints: primary key, foreign key

I have created and manually inserted data into the tables.
This project was done as a part of my bootcamp Master in Data Science Certification from IBM.
